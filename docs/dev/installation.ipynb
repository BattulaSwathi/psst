    "## Installing the proper Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a free, open source language that can be downloaded from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python comes with a package manager called `Pip` which allows you to download pacages to gain extended functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, we recomend** that you do not use the default distribution of Python, but rather, install the Miniconda (or Anaconda) distribution from Continuum Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Why? Many of the Python packages used for scientific applications, like Numpy and Scipy, are written in a mixture of pure Python plus other, lower-level languages, like C or Fortran. Anaconda comes with many of these packages already installed. You don't need all of them, which is why we recomend Miniconda instead of Anaconda. Both Anaconda and Miniconda come with an alternative package manager, `conda,` which lets you install them with greater ease and reliability than when using `pip.` For packages written entirely in Python, you should still use `pip` to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 2 or Python 3?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> PSST should be fully compatible with Python 2.7, but we recomend Python 3 as it is faster, cleaner, more robust, and, well, the future!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download the Miniconda distribution of Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the download [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)\n",
    "- During installation, mark that you do want to add Miniconda to your path\n",
    "- *On Windows,* we recomend installing Miniconda directly under your C:\\ directory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify your installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a command line console (\"command prompt\" on Windows or \"Terminal\" on Mac/ Ubuntu) and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- macOs and Linux -- `which python`\n",
    "- Windows -- `where python`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see output like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- macOs and Linux -- `/home/username/miniconda3/bin/python`\n",
    "- Windows -- `C:\\Miniconda3\\python.exe`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be able trun python from the command line by simply typing `python` or `python3.` \n",
    "\n",
    "You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![python REPL screenshot](imgs/open_python.png)\n",

    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If this isn't working, you might still need to add the Miniconda distribution to your system \"Path\" or place it before an existing installation of Python in your path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at your path from the command line by typing:\n",

    "\n",
    "The process is similar if you're on Windows. Try uninstalling and reinstalling, or manually add the Miniconda executable to your path, by going into `Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables` and then adding the path to your miniconda installation (something like `c:\\.....\\anaconda`) near the front of your PATH variable."
